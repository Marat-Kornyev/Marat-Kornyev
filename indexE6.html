	<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>	<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>		<p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."</p>	<h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>	<ul>		<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>		<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>		<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>		<li>1 t. capers</li>	</ul>	<h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>	<ol>
		<li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possi-ble.</li>		<li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain sometexture.</li>		<li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>	</ol>

	<p><h2><i>Low and Slow</i></h2>  	<small>Posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</small></p>	</header>	<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <q>Cooking for Geeks</q>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>	<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b><br> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p><!--EXERCISE 6-1-->
